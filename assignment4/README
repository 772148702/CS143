    1 Code Generation for Global Constants and Tables
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1.1 CgenClassTable Structures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a number of structures we implemented to hold global
information on classes,  attributes and methods.

class CgenNode : public class__class 
{
 private: 
   CgenNodeP parentnd;                        // Parent of class
   Basicness basic_status;                    // `Basic' if class is basic
                                             // `NotBasic' otherwise
   int tag;                                   // tag for the class(unique number)
   
public:

  std::vector<CgenNodeP> children;                  // Children of class 
  CgenNode(Class_ c,
            Basicness bstatus,
            CgenClassTableP class_table);

  /** mapping for class attributes */
  std::vector<attr_class*> attr_list;

  /** mapping for class methods */
  std::vector<method_sign*> method_list;
  ...
}

class method_sign
{
public:
  Symbol class_name;
  method_class* method_name;
  method_sign(Symbol c, method_class* m) {
    class_name = c;
    method_name = m;
  }
};

In this way, we get ride of addtional maps, but embeded those information inside
CgenNode, it is easy to query its tag, methods and attributes. When assign 
class tag to each CgenNode, we use the depth-first-search algorithm to go through
the inheritance graph, so that we can guarantee, children's tags are larger than 
their parent's tag, this tag assignment methodology will help us in later code 
generation for case.  attr_list and method_list contains a list of attr/method
for each class, which is collected by function build_features_map, and will be 
used later to generate prototype objects and dispatch tables. Note, during the 
collection, we also need to add parent class's attributes and methods to the 
processing class's list and if method has the same name with any parent class's 
method, this method need to be overrided. 

Armed with these structures, we have all the information needed to generate
code for global constants and tables(including code_class_nameTab, code_class_objTab
code_dispatch_table, code_prototype_objects).We need to follow the specifications in
Cool Runtime manual to design the layout and write the code. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1.2 Code Generation for Object Init methods
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since there are optional expressions in attribute initialization code in Cool,
we left the code generation of Object Init methods in a separate pass, after
all global information in CgenClassTable is collected. As a result, we can use
other environment structures to generate code for initialization expressions.


===============================================================================
    2 Environment Design in Code Generation
===============================================================================

As pointed out in lecture, there are three contexts need for operational semantics:
1). Environment: map from variable names to locations
2). Store: map memory locations to values
3). self object

In our implementation, the Environment is implemented in the data structure of Environment:
  int label_cnt;                        // the label counter
  class__class* cur_class;              // the current class
  CgenClassTable* cgen_table;           // the table contains all the class nodes
  SymbolTable<Symbol, char> sym_table;  // this is the mapping of variables to memory locations
  
There are several cases when a new variable is introduced, and they should be added
to the environment:
1). attributes in class
2). formals in method
3). typecases
4). let


===============================================================================
    3 Code Generation Details
===============================================================================

----------------------------------
       3.1 Stack Machine Model 
----------------------------------
We used the stack machine model to implement the code generator. Whenever a new
variable is newed or and expression is evaluated, the return value (as an object
pointer) is always stored in $a0 and pushed to stack. Before and after evaluating
each expression, it is guaranteed that the state of the stack remain unchanged. 


The invariants used in our implementation are:
    - $fp always point to "position 0" of current frame
    - $s0 always hold "self object"
    - $ra always hold return address
    - $a0 always hold evaluation result
    - stack state is the same before and after evaluation of any expression


-----------------------------------
       3.2 Dispatch and Method
-----------------------------------   

When generating code for dispatch, we first code for all the actuals, and push
them to stack one by one. At this point, the stack pointer went from (0) to (1).
Then the body expression is coded and the return object pointer is stored in $a0. Then, the 
class name of e0 is derived. If it's dynamic dispatch, the dispatch table could
be directly obtained by offset of 8 from $a0; If it's static dispatch, the dispatch
table's address should be derived by loading the address the static class's dispatch
table. The next step is to get the offset of the method from the dispatch table
and jump to that method. 

           ------------
          |    Arg1    |    (0, 3)     High Address
           ------------
          |    Arg2    |
           ------------
                :
           ------------
          |    ArgN    |    (1)
           ------------
          |  old $fp   |
           ------------
          |  old $s0   |
           ------------
  FP ->   |    $ra     |    
           ------------
  SP ->   |            |    (2)      Low Address
           ------------
           
Whem generating code for method, first update the "Environment" i.e. the location
of each variable introduced by formals. Then push the callee saved registers: $fp,
$s0 and $ra, and update the frame pointer. Now the stack pointer is at (2). Having
these preparations, we could code the body of the method. Finally, we pop the stack
(including all the arguments) and recover the saved registers. Then the stack frame
shall recover to the original location (3)


----------------------------------
        3.3 Let Expression
----------------------------------

The let expression usually have a bunch of nationalizations. However, Cool treats them
recursively. So in each let expression we need to consider only one new variable.
The initialization of the new variable, if any, is first coded. Then the value returned
by $a0 is pushed to stack and added to the environment. Note the offset relative to the
$fp is stored in the variable cur_exp_oft. After the let expression is finished, the 
environment calls exit scope to delete the address of the new introduced variables.


----------------------------------
        3.4 Case Expression
----------------------------------

The difficult part of generating code for case expression is finding the closest
parent. This is achieved by comparison of class tags. To make this effective, we
allocate each tag by DFS the inheritance graph, so the tags looks like this:
              
              0
          4       1
       6    5   3   2

This scheme has the property that, for any child, its parent tag is smaller than it;
for any parent, all the children has consecutive tag numbers. So to determine if
C is a child of P, we just need to see if the tag of C falls within the range of
P and P's largest child tag, which is obtained recursively. Since we need to find 
the smallest parent, all the case branches are sorted in the beginning. This is
pretty simple since we created a map from tag number to branch class pointer, and 
map inserting is sorted inserting in C++ stl. In this way, the first parent that
we find is guaranteed to be the smallest parent. 

----------------------------------
        3.5 New Expression
----------------------------------

The new expression need to check if the new type is a SELF_TYPE. If so, we need first load
the address of the class object table, then load the class tag from offset 0, 
multiply this tag by 8, add this displacement to the object table to get the class's
prototype, then load this prototype address to $a0, and call Object.copy routine.
If not a SELF_TYPE, we directly get the prototype address by string concatenation,
load this address to $a0, and calls the Object.copy routine. For both cases, the 
final step is to jump to the class's init method.


===============================================================================
    4 Error Checking and Handling
===============================================================================
Error checking and handling is added for the generated program to let the program
exits gracefully when an exception occurs.

----------------------------------
        4.1 dispatch on void
----------------------------------
The program should abort when it tries to dispatch on a void object. Through checking 
of the base address with zero, we are able to discover and report this exception. 

----------------------------------
        4.2 case on void
----------------------------------
The 'case on void' exception is similar to 'dispatch on void'. We used 'Bne' to 
compare the result of the expression with zero register.

----------------------------------
        4.3 missing branch
----------------------------------
If none of the branches can match the given expression, a 'missing branch' 
exception is thrown. We added an extra label to the end of the code for the case 
expression to handle this exception.

===============================================================================
    5 Garbage Collection
===============================================================================
We start with not using the collector. After design finished, we verified our code 
using varied garbage collection flags, -g, -t and -T. In the end, our code is able
to work with garbage collector under any circumstances.
