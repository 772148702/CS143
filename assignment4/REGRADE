We made two minor changes to our code:
1. a typo of comment:
-  if (cgen_debug) //cout << "Building CgenClassTable" << endl;
+  if (cgen_debug) cout << "Building CgenClassTable" << endl;

2. The code() function was called at the wrong place. Just moved a single line of code.
in cgen.cc:951
-  code();
in cgen.cc:155
+  env->cgen_table->code();

after these two changes, all tests except rand1~rand5 should all pass.
